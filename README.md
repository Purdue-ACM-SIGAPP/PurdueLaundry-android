# PurdueLaundry

Laundry App for Purdue University. [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.jhughes.laundry&referrer=utm_source%3Dgithub%26utm_medium%3Dreadme).

Tired of having to go to the laundry room, only to find out that there's no space available? The Purdue Laundry app solves that by having all the details of your dorm's laundry room in the palm of your hand!

We pull information from the Purdue washer and dryer websites. The stability of these websites is out of our hands, unfortunately.
